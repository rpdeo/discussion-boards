* An issue with django-widget-tweaks was noted
  - see https://github.com/jazzband/django-widget-tweaks/issues/60
  - django-widget-tweak seems to be unmaintained and won't work with Django
    2.0, fix is noted in the issue above and seems to work.
* Use of SimpleMDE
  - it seems the form element in the template must have novalidate option set.
  - otherwise simplemde seems to override the submit handler of the button
    within the form, so the form is not submitted.
